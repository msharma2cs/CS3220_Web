                    <p class="text-justify">Welcome to <i>About Me</i> home page of <strong>Mohit Sharma</strong>. I am glad you took out time to visit my page. Well, you must have got my name by now, and if not, its right at the top. Basically, I own an Indian nationality and completed my till date education there before moving to The United States for pursuing Masters in Computer Science. Currently, I am living in Los Angeles, California and enrolled in California State University, Los Angeles campus.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">As the saying goes, the originality of a person grows from its root, same applies to my case with my primary education. The school was well known for its disciplinary actions and that moulded me into like same one. I not only passed out with good grades but a little bit of introvertness. Next part of life was a really difficult one, when I got enrolled in undergraduate program - Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. But, that was also the biggest learning phase of my life, where in I developed myself into an open-minded and a responsible person. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">I experienced the biggest achievement till then date, during my final year of undergraduate program by getting appointed as a Student Placement Coordinator for the entire batch of approximately 450 students. I was passed on the responsibility of being a coordinator between the passing students and the employers. So, by the end of my course, I was a well known face and earned a lot of friends which had made the parting that much more painful.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-justify">A week right after my college, my career took off a flight when I had joined Microfocus as an Associate Software Engineer. Apart from acquiring technical knowledge, I learned to respect people and diversities among them. Two years of industry experience taught me to have calm, focussed, professional, and punctual attitude towards life. I turned into a more honest, simple, straightforward career orientated person.</p>
